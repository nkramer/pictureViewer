	Picture viewer is a tool for photo triage -- reviewing a bunch of photos and deciding which ones stand out above the rest.  To use, tell capture Viewer the directory full of photos to review (the source directory), and also provide a target directory to copy the good photos to (default, Picture Viewer will create a target directory based on the name of the source directory).

To use Picture Viewer, watch the photo slideshow.  When you see a photo you like, press the enter key, or click the check mark icon on the toolbar.  Right-click anywhere for a context menu.
