# Folio

**A photo curation and presentation app that obsesses about the details that matter.**

Folio is built around two core principles: your photos should consume every available pixel on your screen, and transitions between images should be instantaneous. Everything else flows from these commitments.

## Features

### Library View
Your complete photo catalog displayed as a high-density grid. Apply tags to organize your collection, then filter by those tags to find exactly what you're looking for. The grid adapts to your window size to maximize the number of visible thumbnails.

### Slideshow
Full-screen, distraction-free photo viewing. Navigate with arrow keys, mark favorites as you browse, and make initial selections without leaving the viewing experience. Perfect for reviewing recent imports or presenting portfolios.

### Page Designer
Turn selected photos into print-ready photo books. Choose from professionally designed templates that intelligently combine images and text. Export print-ready files ready to send to a print shop for binding.

## What Makes Folio Different

**100% of your pixels, 0% chrome**  
Folio runs fullscreen by default with no toolbars, window borders, or menus competing for space. Your photos get the entire display. Navigation happens through keyboard shortcuts and context menusâ€”right-click anywhere to access controls, or hit `?` to see available shortcuts.

**Instant, preloaded transitions**  
The slideshow engine preloads upcoming photos so advancing to the next image happens with zero delay. Smooth, purposeful animations between slides help you perceive the difference between consecutive images without breaking your flow.

**Three specialized modes, one unified workflow**  
Switch seamlessly between three purpose-built views depending on what you're trying to accomplish.

## Design Philosophy

Folio assumes you're serious about your photos and familiar with keyboard-driven workflows. Rather than hand-holding with visible UI elements, it stays out of your way until you need it. The result is an app that feels responsive, focused, and respectful of your screen real estate.

## Why This Exists

Most photo apps treat screen space like it's abundant and transitions like they don't matter. Folio takes the opposite approach: when you're working with visual content, every pixel counts and every delay disrupts your flow. This app is the tool I wanted but couldn't find.
